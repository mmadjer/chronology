Public repo for chronology, a [QLOCKTWO&reg;](https://qlocktwo.com/en/qlocktwo-classic/) clone built with Flutter.

A clock that tells time in words.
The time is displayed in five minute intervals.
It has a quadratic matrix of letters, where some of the letters are illuminated.
If you need to have a more exact time, look in the corners at the illuminated dots.
